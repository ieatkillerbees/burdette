##Burdette

A Rate-Limiting Library for PHP 5.4+

###What does this do?
This library is primarily designed for APIs that wish to limit how many requests a client can make over a given period
of time. In theory it can be used to throttle any kind of behavior. If you find a neat use case, we'd love to hear 
about it!

###Check back soon
This is a new project! Check back soon for more information!

###What's with the name?
It's an homage to the late, great Josh Burdette, an icon of the Washington, DC music scene. If you would like to know
more about Josh, the University of Maryland (his alma mater) hosts a 
[memorial page](http://www.joshburdettememorial.umd.edu/about.html) for him.
